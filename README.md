# Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning

Here we use machine learning models for predicting diabetes in the [PIMA dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

To run it locally, make sure to do the following:

- Create a python virtual environment
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Open diabetes-ML.ipynb in JupyterLab
